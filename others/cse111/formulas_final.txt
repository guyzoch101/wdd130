CSE 111: Final Project

3rd party library scipy is installed (use constants in scipy)

Heat Transfer and Gas Laws
Pt 1:
	E = mc(delta T)
	E = m(lv or lf)
	P = E/t

Pt 2:
	General Gas Law: P1V1/T1n1 = P2V2/T2n2
	Ideal Gas Law:
		pV = nRT
		pV = (1/3)Nmc^2 (N = no. of molecules; m = mass of 1 molecule; c = root mean square speed)
		pV = (1/3)nMc^2 (n = no. of moles; M = molar mass)
	R: ideal gas constant
		R = 0.0821 atm L/molK or 8.314 J/molK
		KE_avg = (3/2)(R/Na or = k)T
