"""A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that enables its customers
    to order groceries online. After a customer completes an order, the online service
    sends a CSV file that contains the customerâ€™s requests to the grocery store. The
    store needs you to write a program that reads the CSV file and prints to the terminal
    window a receipt that lists the purchased items and shows the subtotal, the sales tax
    amount, and the total."""
