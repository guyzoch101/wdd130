Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

The biggest difference for me coding in cse110 and cse111 is that my codes are more organized.
With the introduction of functions, I was able to group my codes performing a certain action within a function.
Moreover, I can reuse my functions to perform similar actions with the help of passing parameters into it.
Overall, I am able to more fully explain how the code works as it is more organized.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions can check if my functions are working properly. It can be tested without completing the whole programme,
allowing me to identify and possibly fix the code before more code is built upon an error.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

Firstly, I would run the programme, to see what error is raised and displayed in the terminal. Then, I would run its
test functions, if there are one provided, to determine which function went wrong. Then, I would use the debugger to
run through the code step by step. After identifying all bugs and errors, I would fix the code.

I would improve it by adding more exceptions into the programme, and write more test functions for the code, which
they can identify the bugs and errors more accurate and detailed.
